# Changelog for Highcharts Stock v11.4.1 (2024-04-04)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 11.4.1 above also apply to Highcharts Stock 11.4.1.
- Added support for `borderRadius` on flag series with the `squarepin` symbol.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#20807](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/20807), annotations didn't get proportionally resized when dragging a control point. Ordinal axis' `getExtendedPositions` didn't take `dataGrouping` options into account.
- Fixed [#20809](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/20809), panning to extremes caused jumping to incorrect extremes.
- Fixed [#20856](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/20856), a regression in v11.4.0 causing wrong crosshair label position on the right side of the chart.
